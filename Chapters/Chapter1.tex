\section{How it used to be}

Stampix is a startup that prints free photos for clients. Every client gets their own branded web application.

This involves:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Storing all brand-related content in a CMS (Contentful)
	\item Pulling in all that content during app runtime
	\item Deployments for new clients require a lot of manual configuration / dev work
	\item There's no automated tests, which can cause broken deployments if not careful
\end{itemize}

This had a few problems which I will explain in detail later \ldots

\section{Solutions}

Following are the methods used to improve this workflow. Each method will probably get it's own detailed chapter later?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Using a static site generator to build web app and assets during build time
	\item Automated testing
	\item Deploying each built application to AWS
\end{itemize}
