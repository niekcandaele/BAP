Several technologies and metrics were evaluated in this paper. 
Some technologies scored better than others, but which one is the best? 
With any such decision in technology, the answer is: it depends.

In the situation of Stampix, a static site generator is definitely beneficial. 
The ability to fetch assets and build a production ready bundle during runtime will mean a massive performance increase for Stampix.

During the paper, 2 static site generators were looked at: Gatsby and Next. 
While they both had similar results in the performance benchmark (Next scoring slightly worse), I would recommend using Next.
Next can work as a static site generator, as a traditional app or even a hybrid between the two.
This means that Next is the most flexible, allowing Stampix to implement whatever features are necessary.
If Gatsby is chosen, it will not offer the same flexibility and the development team might need to create some ugly "hacks" to make it work.
Furthermore, while developing the PoC applications, I noticed it was easier to find help around Next than Gatsby.
This is a completely subjective point but an important one.

By leveraging IaC, the manual steps of deployment can be automated. 
This is very important, whenever content changes in the CMS, a new build should be triggered, which means builds and deployments happen very frequently.
