\section{Largest contentful paint}

In the figure, it is clear that LCP for a traditional React application is far greater than that of static site generators.

This makes sense: a traditional React application will perform many computational steps during runtime to render the DOM.
Static site generators will perform these computations during the build step.

\section{Total blocking time}

\end{figure}

Similar results from the previous figure can be observed. 
The traditional React application scores much less favorably than the static site generators.
Interestingly, the results for Next seem to spike a lot.
